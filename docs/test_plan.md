# Test Plan for Database Workflow Updates

This document describes the tests required for the new database creation and rename features.

## Unit Tests (`tests/`)

1. **Create New DB with Name**
   - POST `/new_db` with `db_name=client1`.
   - Verify a file `client1.db` is created and `session['db_display_name']` equals `client1.db`.
   - Ensure tables exist by querying `urls`.

2. **Create New DB with Default Name**
   - POST `/new_db` with no name.
   - Expect file `waybax.db` and matching session value.

3. **Rename Database**
   - Start with a temporary database.
   - POST `/rename_db` with `new_name=renamed`.
   - Assert the old file no longer exists and `renamed.db` contains original data.

4. **Invalid Names**
   - Send names with illegal characters (`../bad` or `foo?bar`).
   - Assert response flashes an error and file is unchanged.

5. **Rename While Open**
   - Open a connection to the database.
   - Attempt `/rename_db` and expect an error message due to lock.

## GitHub Actions Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running on pushes and pull requests:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install Python deps
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: pytest -q
      - name: Install Node deps
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint CSS
        run: npm run lint
```

This ensures database workflow tests are executed along with the existing suite and CSS linting on every commit.

## Notes Feature Tests

1. **Add and Retrieve Note**
   - Start with a database containing one URL.
   - POST `/notes` with `url_id=1` and `content=Test`.
   - GET `/notes/1` should return JSON with one note containing `Test`.

2. **Update Note**
   - POST `/notes` with `note_id=<id>` and `content=Updated`.
   - Confirm subsequent `GET /notes/1` shows the updated text.

3. **Delete Note**
   - POST `/delete_note` with `note_id=<id>`.
   - Ensure the note list for that URL is empty.

4. **Delete All Notes**
   - Create two notes, then POST `/delete_note` with `url_id=1` and `all=1`.
   - GET `/notes/1` should return an empty list.

5. **Export Notes**
   - Add notes for multiple URLs.
   - GET `/export_notes` and validate the JSON structure contains each URL and its notes.

## Text Tools Tests

1. **Menu Entry**
   - Click `Tools â†’ Text Tools` from the navbar.
   - Verify the overlay opens only when triggered by this menu option.

2. **URL Encode/Decode**
   - Enter `This is a sketchy string!?"` in the textarea.
   - Click **URL Encode**, then **URL Decode**.
   - The final text should match the original string exactly.

3. **Base64 Round Trip**
   - Input a multiline string using CRLF, LF and CR newlines.
   - Press **Base64 Encode** then **Base64 Decode**.
   - Text should return to the original form without errors.
